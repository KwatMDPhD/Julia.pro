    "1. Type unstable objects need to be heap allocated because they are `Box`ed, which needs allocation.\n",

    "2. Dynamically sized objects (`String`, `Array`, etc) need to be heap allocated, but sometimes their allocations are eliminated (no guarantee and profiling is the only way to be certain).\n",
